        	If you want to, I can help you to build your website, solve simple questions, or even do it from scratch for you!
        </p>
        <p>
        	If you want me to build your website, I recommend you giving me your ideal design (On paper), because my design skills are not the best.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        	I'm a student, so the website could be done fast, or really slowly, depending on the date. <br>
        	Also because of these, the prices will be extremelly cheap.
