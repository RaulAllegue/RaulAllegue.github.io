        <p>Right now, I'm learning how to use node.js and MongoDB.
            <br>I think that, when the page looks professional enough, I would buy a real domain (not a ".github.io" on) and add a real comment and login system, as well as a CRUD for creating articles, without needing to write more html code.

        <p>Today, I practically finished the mobile port of this website, so I can start talking about the webpage with other people.
            <br><br> This was quite hard, and all the code is on my github and active right now!

        <p>The development of today was quite a trouble. <br>
            First of all, I changed the name of the website, to a simpler one. <br>
            I also made all the pages to work.<br>
            Now the only thing left is the newsletter.</p>

        <p>Today I've been making advances in the final design of this website. <br>
            I think it looks good, but it needs quite a lot more content.</p>
