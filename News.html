        <p>The development of today was quite a trouble. <br>
            First of all, I changed the name of the website, to a simpler one. <br>
            I also made all the pages to work.<br>
            Now the only thing left is the newsletter.</p>

        <p>Today I've been making advances in the final design of this website. <br>
            I think it looks good, but it needs quite a lot more content.</p>
