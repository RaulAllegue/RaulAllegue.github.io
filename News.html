        <p>Hi, first of all, I'm sorry because of this week of absence <br>
            I can't talk much about this week, I've been learning mySql, I started its implementation with node and nothing else.
            <br> I am also working on a future porject, but I won't talk much about it until some months by now.
        </p>

        <p>The MySql course is quite simple, but I don't understand the meaning of workbench, why would you write a whole script to run simple commands? I think the only thong it changes is the table visualizer, nothing else.</p>

        <h2>News 15/11/2022</h2>
        <p>I've started learning MySql, it seems much more simple than mongoDB, because I can really visualize the databases.   I use MySql workbench, not the terminal application.</p>

        <h2>News 13/11/2022</h2>
        <p>The Node.js and MongoDB project tutorial is quite confusing, and I think that NoSql type of databases are quite hard. <br>
        I think that I will try MySql, the Sql databases seem simpler for a begginer, but I'll learn NoSql as well, but later.</p>

        <h2>News 10/11/2022</h2>
        <p>Right now, I'm learning how to use node.js and MongoDB.
            <br>I think that, when the page looks professional enough, I would buy a real domain (not a ".github.io" on) and add a real comment and login system, as well as a CRUD for creating articles, without needing to write more html code.

        <p>Today, I practically finished the mobile port of this website, so I can start talking about the webpage with other people.
            <br><br> This was quite hard, and all the code is on my github and active right now!

        <p>The development of today was quite a trouble. <br>
            First of all, I changed the name of the website, to a simpler one. <br>
            I also made all the pages to work.<br>
            Now the only thing left is the newsletter.</p>

        <p>Today I've been making advances in the final design of this website. <br>
            I think it looks good, but it needs quite a lot more content.</p>
