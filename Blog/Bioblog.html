		<h1>Biology Blog</h1>
		<br>
		<p>As a class project, I've had to make a blog to publish articles during the course.</p>
		<p>As always, I started from scratch; at first, I tried to use a pattern for the background, but I didn't get it going. Then I tried making a 'Card' based structure, and it worked surprisignly well.</p>
		<br>
		<p>I only had to make the template, so I used the same base for the article file.</p>
		<p>I also added a side-bar menu, as a personal challenge; and I automated it usign javascript.</p>
		<p>Then, I added a home button in every article.</p>
