        <h2>Making of: MiniText and Clock</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Before starting my way in webdev, I tried making some simple Python apps,
   <br> and these is the "Making Of" of one of them.
    </p>
    <p>"Clock" is just a simple clock app that I made in an afternoon.</p>
    <br>
    <p>To start, MiniText is a really small and simple text editor.
    <br> I made it with the idea of using it in digital classes.
    </p>
    <p>I wanted to made it as a 'final' Python project to prove how much I've learnt.
        <br> On the way, everything was quite smooth,
        <br> I could solve almost every single problem thas appeared.
    </p>
    <p>Then, I tried publishing it on Itch.io, but I couldn't make the executable.</p>
    <br>
    <p>And finally, 8 months after that, I tried re-making my first app, a clock, all by myself.</p>
    <p>The result? I simply couldn't.</p>
