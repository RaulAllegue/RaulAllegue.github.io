        <h2>Making of SopasDeLetras</h2>
    <p>I started this project about March 2022. 
        <br>The original idea was to create a "Find the Differences" game, but it was way to hard</p>
    <br>
    <p>So, after thinking about it, I officially started the development. 
        <br>At the beggining, it was pretty straight forward; creating the structure, adding css... 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>But when I had to start adding the javascript, it became so much difficult:
        <br>The words started to scramble, they didn't appear, over all, it didn't work.
        <br>So, I deleted the js file and restarted from scratch.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>In the letter soup, there used to be 3 words at a time, but I simplified it to only 1 word
        <br>Then I started to take the player input, that was not as easy as it can look.
        <br>After finishing all of these, I had to solve tons of bugs that were really tricky.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>When I finished solving them, I started adding final details, like:
        <br>tips that appear if you don't click.
        <br>Secret messages...
    </p>

    <br>
    <p>And, after all this tough work, I published it!
        <br> You can play it clicking <a href="https://sopasdeletras.github.io">right here</a>
        <br> PD: I'm Spanish, so I used my native language to build the project
