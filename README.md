My Blog


The objective of this blog is to have an archive of my learning process, with real examples to improve my experience.

I know nobody watches this blog, it's for personal satisfaction, but, if you find it interesting, I'll be grateful of you to talk about it.


PD: I'm quite young, so, even though it doesn't look that profesional, it is the best I'm able to.  If you know what are you talking about (in terms of graphics design), please give me some recomendations (via email)
